                This application has the primary objective of transcribing a 19th century handwritten Greek register from a parish church transcription. Most of the transcription is in Greek and is challenging because of its use of abbreviations and old-fashioned idiom. 
                It is not necessarily a text that most modern Greek speakers will find easy to decipher, but we are hoping that there are some who can! The task is made more difficult still by the occasional presence of bits of text written in Italian and English which we would also like to transcribe where possible (but you can leave these out if you prefer). 
                Finally, the contributor is invited to add an approximate English translation of the transcribed text if they wish (although this is not is also not compulsory). 
                The platform will present a scanned page loaded directly from the digital repository of the Greek State Archives (you will notice the watermark of the latter stamped into the page and all terms and conditions for use of this scan follow those of the Greek State Archives).
            	Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked to transcribe (and optionally translate) the contents of each page. 
            	An example portion of a register page is provided below:

                Some further bits of guidance as you transcribe:
                <ul>    
                    <li>Please transcribe the text as accurately as possible, following the original letter/word case, lines and punctuation.</li> 
                    <li>Try to enter all the text that you see, in the right order.</li>
                    <li>If you need to skip text because it is not recogniseable, use the symbol [...] including the square brackets, to signal this omission. If you skip more than one line, repeat this symbol per line.</li>     
                    <li>If you want to pass any comments on to us, in the middle of the text, place them in square brackets. For example, if a word is hard to decipher, do your best to identify it and then you might put [uncertain, alternative: 'Ποταμού']</li>
                    <li>The application accepts accented Greek characters (UTF-8, including polytonic), so feel free to use these.</li>
                </ul>            
                </p>

                The box for adding an English translation is wholly optional because our priority is on producing a good Greek transcription. However, if you are able to offer an approximate English translation, then please bear in mind the following points:
                <ul>    
                    <li>The structure of the translation should roughly follow that of the transcription, so use the same symbols to indicate omissions. </li>
                    <li>As with the transcription, if a word is hard to decipher, do your best to identify it and make a comment to note the problem.</li>    
                </ul>            
                </p>
